Dear Recruiter 
 I am seeking an internship position in Computer Science where I can help discover solutions for many of the problems users encounter in your company. To prepare for my career, I am pursuing my education degree from the University Of San Francisco and majoring in Computer Science and Marketing. I know theoretical applications and have individual ability to help develop new technology to solve many of the problems associated with the computer industry. For example, I have been completed a search engine project by using the Java program language last semester. In this project, I learned how to use multithreading, object-encapsulation, and spider-crawling. The most thoughtful and interesting part I like is spider-crawling skill because I would like to use my technical skill to discover the unknown information which hides on the Internet and look for a potential solution to solve the business issue. After leaving this internship, I hope I can have the practical experience and more understand of the real world in the field of the Software industry.
  I can work immediately and work as long as you would like to work with me. Please giving me chance to show you my ability. My phone number is 9739800286 and the email address is paulke29@yahoo.com. I am looking forward to hearing from you back.
Thanks
Paul
